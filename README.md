# allyourpasswords
The 100% swift offline-only password manager

### No electron

Although I am more proficient at making websites, I don't like electron "apps" taking away all of my battery and spinning up my CPU to 100% randomly, so swift it is.

### The process

I logged every day of the 30 day process it took me to make this thing [here on a dev focused blogging platform](https://dev.to/swlkr/day-1-making-a-native-macos-password-manager-for-people-who-hate-the-cloud-3j68)

### Support

If you want to support future dev efforts with cold hard cash, you can buy it either from my (very basic) lander here: [allyourpasswords.com](https://allyourpasswords.com) or from the [mac app store here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/all-your-passwords/id1450537302?mt=12)

If you don't want to pay the full price of the app in the mac app store, you can use the code ph-50 after you click the buy button on the lander, it uses paddle and devmate, so it requires an email to send the .app file to, just trying to be as upfront as possible here.
